/*
Stack Min

The stack structure would have an underlying array with the same size as the total
number of nodes in the stack to keep track of the state of the minimum number on
every operation.
# initial stack
{ 3, 2, 7, 1, 2 } # stack
[ 3, 2, 2, 1, 1 ] # array
# pop
{ 3, 2, 7, 1 }
[ 3, 2, 2, 1 ]
# pop
{ 3, 2, 7 }
[ 3, 2, 2 ] # now the minimum is 2
this allows for the pop, push and min methods to be constant
